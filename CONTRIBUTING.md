# How to contribute

The best way to contribute to QIF is to [join the Dimensional Metrology Standards Consortium (DMSC)](http://qifstandards.org/about-dmsc/). The DMSC is the governing body for ANSI QIF, and this is where you can really make a difference. 

**What are some of the benefits of joining the DMSC?**

 * Great networking opportunity for like-minded movers and shakers in industry
 * Visibility to ongoing discussion and development of the future QIF versions
 * Ensuring that _your_ organization has its say in the direction of this critical standard
 * Make a statement that you and your company support industrial standards
 * Just to help the growth of industry!

That said, you don't need to be a DMSC member to participate with the QIF community! Here are some other ways you can contribute: 

 * Submit an enhancement request, or ask a question ([see our wiki article on the Issues list](https://github.com/QualityInformationFramework/qif-community/wiki/Issues))
 * Download some of our QIF-related code from the repository, or create a pull request for a new tool you have created, or improvements you suggest!
 * Submit tutorials or examples for our wiki

If you have any questions, please feel free to [get in touch with us](http://qifstandards.org/contact-us/)!
